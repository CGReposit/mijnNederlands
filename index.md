Welcome to my personal project for learning Dutch.  
This repository serves as both a structured learning journal and a resource library.

---

I decided to learn Dutch in 2023. It had been a while since I seriously attempted to learn another language. After two years and even having moved to the Netherlands, I still do not have a level I consider sufficient 🥲 So I decided to make this Github page to consolidate all the many tools and resources I use to learn this language in one place. Hopefully, by incorporating coding and other elements, the memorization that typically goes into learning a language will be easier

---

📚 Goals
- Reach **CEFR Level B2** by the end of 2026.
- Improve comprehension of Dutch media (news, podcasts, and conversation).
- Build a vocabulary of at least **5,000 words**.

🗂️ Structure

|---------|----------|
| `/diary` | Learning logs and progress notes |
| `/vocab` | Thematic vocabulary lists |
| `/grammar` | Grammar explanations and summaries |
| `/resources` | Books, podcasts, and online resources |
| `/exercises` | Writing, translation, and listening practice |

---

🧩 Tools & Techniques
- **Anki** for spaced repetition
- **DutchPod101** for listening practice

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
