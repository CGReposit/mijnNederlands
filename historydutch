## Origins

The Dutch language, known as **_Nederlands_** in its native form, belongs to the **West Germanic branch** of the Indo-European language family. Its earliest roots can be traced back to the **Frankish dialects** spoken by Germanic tribes in what is now the Netherlands and northern Belgium.  

These dialects evolved from **Old Low Franconian**, a blend of Proto-Germanic and local tribal languages.

## Old Dutch (ca. 500–1150)

**Old Dutch**, also called **Old Low Franconian**, marks the first stage of Dutch as a distinct language.  

- Few written records survive, mostly inscriptions, glosses, and early religious texts.  
- Influences from **Old High German** and **Latin** shaped vocabulary and grammar.  
- Christianity introduced Latin terms via monastic scholarship.  

> Example: Early glosses in Latin texts provide some of the first written evidence of Dutch words.

## Middle Dutch (ca. 1150–1500)

**Middle Dutch** is characterized by regional diversity and the emergence of literature:  

- Epic poems, religious writings, and legal texts appear across the Low Countries.  
- Trade and urban growth led to some standardization, though dialects remained diverse.  
- French and Flemish influences enriched vocabulary and pronunciation.  

> Notable works: *Van den vos Reynaerde* (Reynard the Fox) – a famous Middle Dutch epic.

## Early Modern Dutch (ca. 1500–1800)

During the Renaissance, **Early Modern Dutch** saw major standardization:  

- The printing press enabled wider dissemination of texts, stabilizing grammar and spelling.  
- Vocabulary expanded with loanwords from Latin, French, Spanish, and Portuguese due to trade and colonization.  
- The **Statenvertaling** (1637), a Dutch Bible translation, played a key role in language standardization.  

> Quote: "The Statenvertaling helped unify Dutch grammar and orthography across regions."

## Modern Dutch (1800–Present)

**Modern Dutch** emerged in the 19th century with further standardization:  

- Official norms were formalized by the **Taalunie** in 1980.  
- Dutch is now spoken by over **23 million native speakers** in the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, and parts of the Caribbean.  
- The language continues to evolve, absorbing foreign words while maintaining its Germanic roots.

- Regional diversity  
- Trade and colonization  
- Religious influence and literature
