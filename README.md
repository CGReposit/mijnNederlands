# mijnNederlands
Welcome to my personal Github page for learning Dutch. 

I decided to learn Dutch in 2023. It had been a while since I seriously attempted to learn another language. After two years and even having moved to the Netherlands, I still do not have a level I consider sufficient 🥲 So I decided to make this Github page to consolidate all the many tools and resources I use to learn this language in one place. Hopefully, by incorporating coding and other elements, the memorization that typically goes into learning a language will be easier.
